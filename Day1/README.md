## Part a

The expected result for the data of the provided example (example_a.txt) is **142**

## Part b

The proposed solution makes uses of cyclic arrays because I wanted to get used to them. A solution where the check for previous characters is done directly in the main content buffer is possible

The expected result for the data of the provided example (example_b.txt) is **281**
