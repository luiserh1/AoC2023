## Part a

The proposed solution makes uses of 2D matrices because I wanted to get used to them. A solution where the check for previous characters is done directly in the main content buffer is possible. Nonetheless, this implementation is, in my opinion, more readable and "easy" to implement

The expected result for the data of the provided example (example_a.txt) is **4361**

## Part b

Thanks to the structure defined in the previous part, the solution for this one has been as easy as updating the code that looped over it.

The expected result for the data of the provided example (example_a.txt) is **467835**
